# Linux-papers
Linux writeups i found effective for injection,infection,evasion,persistence,system components and abuses.
POC code will be released soon.
I decided to halt upload due to inconveniences of exams..
See you soon in weeks??


CRedit goes to https://www.vx-underground.org/ for providing writeups.
